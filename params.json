{"name":"jAlert","tagline":"Simple & Thin jQuery Alert!","body":"### Overview.\r\nThis is just another jQuery alert designed by @abeautifulsite and not maintained by the author. But since it seems to be the easy, neat and tiny plugin, I'm bringing it back to life from where the makers left it! The total minified file size of JS & CSS is ~6KB!\r\n\r\n### Why another jQuery plugin? Because Enterprise!\r\nWhen you have plethora of better, beautiful sleek alert plugins, why am I bringing such old alert back? This is what I asked before I moved the source from original host! Well, the answer is, this is what worked for my requirement. If you have the freedom to choose which browsers your application is going to run, then I'm sure no one will have a look at this plugin. But in enterprise application development, where IE 7/8 is still the mainstream browser, this plugin will be a boon! Right, this one works out of the box from IE6 and up!! So with little modifications and less effort, you can have custom alert rather than banging your head on the wall to figure out why some good looking alert is not working in older versions of browsers!\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\nInclude the CSS/JS files somewhere in the page(js should be after jQuery! Duh!)\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"jquery.alerts.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n    <link href=\"jquery.alerts.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\r\n\r\nand call the alert like \r\n\r\n    jAlert('This is a custom alert box', 'Alert Dialog');\r\n\r\n### Type of Alert\r\njAlert plugin has regular Alert, prompt and confirm. You can add HTML's inside the message, modify the styles dynamically based on the pages/modules as you wish. It is that easy!\r\n\r\n_Regular Alert_\r\n\r\n    jAlert('This is a custom alert box', 'Alert Dialog');\r\n\r\n_Prompt_\r\n\r\n    jPrompt('Type something:', 'Prefilled value', 'Prompt Dialog', function(r) {\r\n     if( r ) alert('You entered ' + r);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n_Confirm_\r\n\r\n    jConfirm('Can you confirm this?', 'Confirmation Dialog', function(r) {\r\n     jAlert('Confirmed: ' + r, 'Confirmation Results');\r\n    });\r\n\r\n_With HTML_\r\n\r\n    jAlert('You can use HTML, such as bold, italics, and underline!');\r\n\r\n_Custom Confirm_(Add your own button name, wherever you need instead of plain OK & Cancel!)\r\n\r\n    jCustomConfirm('Can you confirm this custom dialog?', 'Confirm Header', 'Think about it', 'Maybe Later');\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dynamic Styling with Custom CSS_\r\n\r\n    /* Custom dialog styles */\r\n\t\t\t#popup_container.style_1 {\r\n\t\t\t\tfont-family: Georgia, serif;\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: #A4C6E2;\r\n\t\t\t\tbackground: #005294;\r\n\t\t\t\tborder-color: #113F66;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t#popup_container.style_1 #popup_title {\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: #FFF;\r\n\t\t\t\tfont-weight: normal;\r\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: left;\r\n\t\t\t\tbackground: #76A5CC;\r\n\t\t\t\tborder: solid 1px #005294;\r\n\t\t\t\tpadding-left: 1em;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t#popup_container.style_1 #popup_content {\r\n\t\t\t\tbackground: none;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t#popup_container.style_1 #popup_message {\r\n\t\t\t\tpadding-left: 0em;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t#popup_container.style_1 INPUT[type='button'] {\r\n\t\t\t\tborder: outset 2px #76A5CC;\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: #A4C6E2;\r\n\t\t\t\tbackground: #3778AE;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\nAssign it to any event!\r\n\r\n    // Add it for button!\r\n    $(\".alert_style_example\").click( function() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t$.alerts.dialogClass = $(this).attr('id'); // set custom style class\r\n\t\t\t\t\tjAlert('This is the custom class called &ldquo;style_1&rdquo;', 'Custom Styles', function()    {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$.alerts.dialogClass = null; // reset to default\r\n\t\t\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\t\t});\r\n\r\n**To Change Opacity**, just add $.alerts.overlayOpacity = 0.1; and to change color, $.alerts.overlayColor = #000000;on document.ready to make it work!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nContributors are welcome to make it look better or add anything as you wish!\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**\r\nIt supports IE7 and above!
